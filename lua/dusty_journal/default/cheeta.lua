Woohoo!
The stand-by time is finally over! There haven't been any missions these past few days, and I had to be on stand-by all the time without being allowed to go out. I couldn't even see Honey Badger. I couldn't stand another second of such boring days!

It seems like a lot of people are missing from headquarters, even Caretaker’s gone, and life has gotten way too dull.
Caretaker's Caretaker—Miss Helian—said she'd send me the next work assignment and told me to find her after I receive it. I wonder what she wants... Just to be clear, I'm not scared of her or anything, and it's not like I don't want to see her. It's just that she always has this cold, stern face that makes you feel like no matter what you say, she'll just shoot it down.
But when I applied to stay at Griffin, she agreed without saying anything... Well, duh! What else would she say to a genius like me? Griffin’s going through a really tough time, right? They can't do without someone as talented as me who can handle five tasks at once! Ah, speaking of which, Caretaker's Caretaker just sent over a mission... Why is the notification sound going off non-stop? Uh, so many?!
Staring at the new message notifications popping up on the terminal screen, I thought for a moment and hit the mute button. If so many missions are coming in at once, it means they probably aren't urgent, right? Anyway, I'll put them aside for now and go find Honey Badger for a showdown! I've got a new strategy that will definitely make her admit defeat this time!
Hmm, at this time she should be...

Where is she? 
Like a super-efficient robot vacuum, I swept through every place I could think of, but I couldn't find any trace of Honey Badger. 
Ugh, don't tell me that scaredy-cat ran away?
"What are you doing here?" 
Uh-oh— 
I turned my head stiffly. It was her... Caretaker's Caretaker. Oh no, if I tell her I put the super important mission aside to hunt down Honey Badger for a duel, I'm toast!
"I—I lost something," I blurted out, instantly squatting down and pretending to search the ground.
"What did you lose? If it's important, we can check the surveillance footage," she said, rubbing her temple. Then she continued in the exact same tone, "But your priority should be completing your mission. I sent the list to your terminal earlier, but I haven't received any reply."
"I-I know that! I was totally about to look at it super carefully before replying!" I stammered, suddenly feeling less awesome as I looked at her crossed arms. "But hey, forget about that for a sec—do you know where Honey Badger is? I can't find her anywhere!"
"Honey Badger?" She narrowed her eyes. Yikes, she looks even scarier!
"Didn't you say you were looking for something you lost? Did you lose Honey Badger?"
Aaah!! "Umm—" Think fast, genius MP7!
"I... uh... I actually think Honey Badger might've taken whatever I lost! Yeah, that's it!"
I was pretty proud of that excuse. I tried to look cool, putting my hands behind my head as I faced the ice queen. Her eyebrow twitched, and I could've sworn I heard teeth grinding.
...Nah, I must be hearing things!

After what felt like forever, she closed her eyes and let out a silent sigh. "Honey Badger... has already left."
Wow, she actually answered me! Wait a sec, what did she say—
"Left... gone?" It took my super-smart neural cloud a few seconds to compute that. A pretty rare situation for a genius like me!
"You mean she's not here anymore? But... how come? Where'd she go? Why'd she leave?"
Caretaker's Caretaker started rubbing her temples again.
"It was her choice. She didn't stay with Griffin and refused reassignment. Griffin won't interfere with where she decided to go, and so there’s no record of it."
So... Honey Badger just vanished? Went poof without a word? I'll never see her again?
The ice queen continued, "As for why, I suppose she has things she wants to do."
Things she wants to do—ha! I get it now. I, the genius, have figured it all out!
"Hmph, bet she ran off somewhere to secretly upgrade her system, right?" I said, hands on my hips, looking all smug. "That's just like her lame ideas. Pfft, even if she got a million upgrades, she'd still never beat me!"

I mean, duh! Even if she hides and levels up, she's only making herself stronger. But me? I'll become the superstar Doll of the PMC world with my amazing skills! Everyone will want Griffin for their missions, and we'll be number one again! Then I'll go down in history as Griffin's savior—just thinking about that title gets me really pumped! Ha, Honey Badger could never reach my level!
I stood up straight, feeling all fired up, and looked at the ice queen.
"Hey, Ms. Caretaker's Caretaker!"
"...Are you talking to me?"
"Of course! Give me a mission already! I'm gonna put Griffin back on top!" I thumped my chest to look extra reliable. "Heh, bet that sneaky Honey Badger can't do this! All she's got waiting for her is her crying her eyes out when she realizes how awesome I am!"

I stood there, hands on hips, waiting for... well, anything. But Caretaker's Caretaker just looked even sterner.
"Let's leave Honey Badger out of this... Didn't I just send you the mission details?"
"Oh, right..." What's going on? Is it 'cuz Honey Badger's gone? I'm so off my game today! I pulled out my terminal and checked the unread stuff.
"Let's see what super important thing needs my genius—fixing a tractor? Huh?" I looked up at her, but she was still all stony-faced. I double-checked the mission. "Why... why do I have to do this boring stuff?"
"You seem to have the expertise."
"That's not the point!" I shoved the terminal in her face. "I'm asking why you're bothering me—the greatest genius of the century—over such trivial tasks?!"
She took a deep breath.
"There is no such thing as a trivial mission."

Ugh, there she goes again with that boring serious talk. I'm not falling for it! I quickly checked the other missions: Finding lost pets, doing maintenance on power generators, updating boring systems... What even is this?
"Hold up, I thought Griffin was a PMC, not some housekeeping service!" I felt my own brow furrowing to match hers. "What's with all these lame missions?"
This time, she didn't clam up, but she still sounded all calm and collected.
"MP7, Griffin isn't what it used to be anymore... We have to start small."

"But... but!" My confidence deflated under her icy stare. "Doing this stuff won't show how amazing I am! I won't stand out at all... Forget becoming Griffin's savior or making that Honey Badger admit I'm better. She'd probably just laugh at me... I..."
Caretaker's Caretaker pursed her lips, looking even colder: "...What was that about Griffin's savior?"
"Ah, that's... that's not important!" I quickly looked down. Ugh, maybe I should just take this stupid mission on?
...No way! I can't give up!

"I get it."
Huh?
"Then, I'll give you this mission."
A new message popped up on my terminal. A combat mission to take out some armed bandits... Tsk, this kind of thing used to be no big deal, but now...

"Alrighty, I'll do it!"

Ugh, Caretaker’s Caretaker is glaring at me like some creepy gargoyle statue. 

What's her problem? Tsk, it's just a few magnetizing doohickeys and magnetic field thingamajigs. No biggie! I totally nailed a mission all by myself... Okay, maybe it wasn't exactly a huuuge mission... But hey, at least it beats fixing cars or chasing after lost puppies! 
Sigh... If I'd known it'd be such a pain, I might've thought up something even more brilliant back then.

"Are you reflecting on your actions?" 
Whoa, the gargoyle speaks!
"Reflect on what? This isn't my fault!" I crossed my arms, ready to school this gargoyle on some facts. "Look, I told you already. The bad guys were all spread out in different spots, about to make a run for it. If they'd reached the contamination zone, it would've been a total nightmare! I had to figure out how to hit 'em all at once. And since I can't be everywhere at the same time—"
"So you decided to modify magnetizing devices to make everything metal magnetic, then used magnetic field generators to stick the enemies to the ground?" The gargoyle rubbed her forehead like she had a headache. After a pause, she asked, "How on earth did you come up with this idea..."
"What's wrong with my idea? It worked, didn't it?!" She's actually questioning my genius plan!
"How is this any different from pouring glue on the ground to stop them from escaping?"
"Glue? Seriously? That'd never hold 'em down!" This lady is totally clueless!

The gargoyle covered her eyes with her hand. "What I mean is—"
"Alright, alright, enough with the nagging." I put my hands behind my back, kicking the floor with my toe. Maybe if I look a little sorry, she'll lay off. "I just happened to have this stuff lying around, so I came up with this super cool idea. You gotta admit, it's quite an interesting and unusual sight to behold, right? Plus, mission accomplished! Isn't it all fine and dandy?"
And hey, this awesome operation gave me a brilliant new idea! If I don't get to show off my skills on missions, why not find a way to make Griffin super famous? Then everyone will think, 'Wow, Griffin is amazing!'
Yeah, this plan is genius... If everyone thinks Griffin is awesome, that means I saved Griffin!
And if I save Griffin, Caretaker will have a home to return to!
But the best part? This operation helped me come up with the most brilliant plan ever!
"Forget about all that boring stuff. I've got an idea—"

"Fine and dandy? Have you not noticed the unexpected losses we suffered because of this mission?"
The gargoyle tapped the table with her finger, cutting me off. Rude!
"Oh come on... it's just a few magnetizing gizmos plus—"
"And what about the damage to your frame?"
"That—that was just a tiny accident!" Ugh, why's she gotta keep bringing that up?
"Well, okay, so maybe the plan was a teensy bit rough. I mean, we were in a rush and all... And yeah, I might've gotten a little stuck to the ground too... And even though the bad guys couldn't move, they could still kinda fight back... So I got a few scratches..."
"Scratches?"
"Okay, fine! Maybe I took a few direct hits! But who cares about little details like that? Geniuses don't sweat the small stuff!" I shook my head and shrugged. "Besides, who else could've thought of using magnets to stop the bad guys from running away? Ha! Even on a tiny mission, I solve problems with pure genius!"

The gargoyle's eyebrow twitched. She pressed a hand to her forehead again and took a couple deep breaths.
"Couldn't we have solved this in a more... normal way? Like using a Dummy squad to attack from different locations?"
"Normal? Boring! How's that gonna get anyone's attention? It totally ruins my plan to reach my target, so no way!"
"Attention..." Her eyes got all spacey for a second. "Right now... Griffin has already got so many eyes on it; does it really need any more attention?"
"Huh?" What's she going on about now?
The gargoyle ignored me and started muttering to herself.
"Griffin's not what it used to be... Who'd believe in Griffin now? Under these circumstances... should we even keep Griffin going? If we do that... then... it must be in some another way..."
I didn't catch all of that, but I heard those last few words perfectly clear!
She said—some other way! Has she come to the same conclusion as me?

I slammed my hands on the table, getting right in the gargoyle's face.
"That's it!"
The noise snapped her out of it. She went back to her usual ice-queen look, but with a hint of surprise.
"What...?"
"This is it! Another way!" I smacked the table again. "We need another way—right now, we're getting all these lame little jobs 'cuz nobody thinks Griffin is as awesome as before, right? These trivial tasks are wasting my incredible talents! So, to save Griffin, we’ve gotta try something totally different!"
"..."
Caretaker's Caretaker just stared at me in confusion. Ha! Guess she didn't think of a specific 'other way' after all.
"Even if I can't be a superstar on missions, if we find a way to make Griffin super famous all at once, we'll get everyone's trust back and score some real missions!" I stretched out my arms and did a little spin. "And by doing this, I'll still be Griffin's ultimate savior. Ha! I really am a genius!"

"...That's not what I meant by 'some other way'—wait, MP7."
Caretaker's Caretaker came out from behind her desk and grabbed my shoulder. Whoa, personal space much? I'm getting nervous here.
"What are you planning? You're not about to cause more trouble, are you?"
The mumbling Caretaker's Caretaker has returned to full gargoyle mode, giving me the works.
"Uh... I..."

No way, if I spill the beans now, she'll totally shut me down!
"I-I'm gonna do something epic that'll go down in Griffin history!"
I brushed her hand away and backed up fast.
"How else am I gonna make that Honey Badger admit I'm the best? Just you wait and see!"
"MP7!"
I shouted something that sounded way more confident than I felt and bolted out of the gargoyle's office, trying my best to ignore the angry yelling coming from inside.
Phew, that was close! Can't let her find out about my genius plan... Gotta move fast. Once I show her the incredible results, she won't be able to say no!
Operation Genius starts tonight!

Woooaahh... this warehouse is huuuuge! 
Super high ceilings, practically empty... I can even hear my own voice echo in here! Score one for Team Genius, finding the perfect spot!
I shrugged off my massive backpack and started unpacking my secret weapons. These babies are drones I MacGyvered from spare parts. Nobody knows about 'em, and they're the key to my master plan. I call 'em "hover modules"—part drone, part portable magnetic field generator.
My last brilliant "magnetic suction" tactic got me thinking... If I can stick people to the ground, why not flip the script and make stuff float? 
It's just magnetic levitation, baby!
Humans freak out over anything floating in the air. They see a light in the sky and scream "UFO!" Sure, drones are everywhere now, but seeing something really weird floating around? That'll blow their minds! So, picture this: Griffin HQ, just chillin' in mid-air. People's jaws will hit the floor!
No other PMC has ever pulled this off. When Griffin does it? BAM! Everyone'll know we're top dog again. We'll be swimming in high-stakes missions!
Heh, only a genius like me could save Griffin. That stick-in-the-mud Caretaker’s Caretaker? She'd never dream up something this epic!
But no worries. Once I pull this off, she'll finally get how crucial I am!

Alright, experiment time!
I'm calling this bad boy "Operation: Savior." Step one? Build some seriously powerful hover modules. That's what today's test is all about.
I dragged over a couple boxes from the corner. Combat gear, mostly metal. Heavy as heck, but perfect for my experiment.
I tied those suckers together, did some genius-level calculations on weight distribution, metal content, center of gravity... y’know, the works. Plugged it all into my custom formula to figure out the magnetic juice I'd need, how many drones, and where to stick 'em. Then I magnetized those boxes and slapped the hover modules—I mean, the magnetic field generators—on both sides.
Now, I'm no dummy. I knew regular batteries wouldn't cut it for long-term hovering. So, I went full solar power, baby! Saves energy AND keeps the module count manageable. What can I say? Genius is as genius does.

With prep work done, I fired up those hover modules. BAM! Boxes off the ground, just like that.
I carefully worked the remote. The magnetic field generators purred to life. Both sides of the hover modules buzzed like angry bees, lifting those boxes skyward.
I nudged the joystick, trying to steer by tweaking the module positions. Those floating boxes did a sweet turn, looped around in a big circle, and landed right in front of me smooth as butter.
Ha! Piece of cake! Looks like Operation: Savior is a go!
But a true genius never gets cocky. Gotta collect more data, you know?
I grabbed a few more boxes, tied 'em up, and got ready for round two.
This time, I tweaked the magnetic field range and strength based on my calculations. Four hover modules, one on each corner of my box tower. Hit the power... and they didn't get as high. Hmm, not enough oomph? Time to fine-tune the formula.
I pushed the joystick. The hover modules roared louder than before. My box stack made a wider circle this time. Looks like the weaker lift messed with the steering too.
Ugh, what a pain... Gotta make some upgrades.
Just adding more modules might throw off the balance... Oh! I haven't messed with the center of gravity yet! Okay, new plan: Test how different weight distributions affect the hover, then tweak everything at once. It's just fine-tuning, right? No biggie.
I scoured the warehouse for something metal, weirdly shaped, and just the right weight. But all I found were more boxes and random bits of combat gear. Nothing quite—
Wait a sec! The perfect test subject was right under my nose!
I smacked my forehead. Duh! My body is perfect—decent weight, off-center gravity, mostly metal, and it magnetizes so well I got stuck to the ground last time. It's like I was built for this!
Oh man, I really am a genius!

I recalculated everything, magnetized myself, set up the hover modules, and plonked my butt right on top of those boxes.
Gotta be extra careful with the controls this time... It’s my own behind on the line, after all.
The boxes wobbled and rose, drones and magnets working overtime. My dangling feet were a good four meters off the ground. Hey, not bad! Pretty stable. Let's try a spin... No problem! Guess I was worried over nothing.
Ha! Geniuses don't make mistakes. If it can handle this, it can probably handle anything, right?
I cranked that joystick to max. My box tower and I went zooming left. Just before we splattered against the wall, I yanked the stick. The magnetic field generators responded, but momentum's a beast—we shook like crazy before steadying out.
It was like riding a mechanical bull made of boxes! So awesome!
I kept pushing it, making tighter and tighter turns. It was like that old video game... what was it called? Oh yeah, Snake!
Okay, now for the grand finale—WHOA!

I totally forgot to strap myself down! Those crazy turns were too much—I started sliding off! Luckily, I grabbed the edge of a box just in time. The remote? Not so lucky. It went splat on the ground.
Well, even geniuses can't break the laws of physics. But hey, not face-planting counts as a win in my book! Now, how to land this thing... Hold up, what's that noise?
It sounds like... oh no, the hover module's engine!

I looked up just in time to see one of the modules on my side spitting sparks and making a horrible racket. Then it just... died.
Uh-oh.
Everything went to hell in an instant. With the lift all out of whack, it was chaos. Hover module yanking the boxes, boxes yanking me, all of us pinballing around the warehouse like some magnetically charged nightmare.
I glanced down, trying to gauge how much damage a freefall would do to my body. The world was a blur, but my genius brain crunched the numbers.
Good news: I probably wouldn't explode on impact. Bad news: Everything else.
Only one option left!

I let go.
WHAM! I hit the ground hard. Before I could even groan, it started raining boxes. Guns, ammo, and who knows what else came showering down, burying me in a pile of military-grade stupidity.
Talk about rotten luck! I shoved stuff off me, trying to crawl out, but... I couldn't budge. The magnetic field generator must've flipped polarity when the remote hit the ground.
So now I'm basically a really annoyed fridge magnet. Stuck to the floor. Awesome.
I tried to break free, but more junk kept falling. My hover modules—aka the drones—were coming down. Wait a sec... how many of those things did I use? And didn't I pack them full of extra power cells?
Oh no. No-no-no-no—

Ugh... huh? What time is it? I was supposed to be prepping for my awesome experiment tonight—why am I suddenly in sleep mode and stuck in a maintenance pod? This won't do—hm?

Hold on a sec. This isn't my room... Who's that guy? Why is there some random dude here?!
Oh no, did the URNC finally figure out how amazingly smart I am and sent someone to kidnap me—
"Oh, so you’re finally awake?"
The maintenance pod lid popped open, and the guy fiddling with equipment poked his head over.
"Looks like the calibration worked. Can you run a self-diagnostic?"
"...Who are you?" I eyeballed him suspiciously.
"This is Dier, our mechanic."
"Eep!" It's Caretaker's Caretaker!
She's here too? Did she find out about my brilliant plan and come to stop me?

"Hello, MP7."
"Oh, uh, hi... Don't think we've ever met..."
I caught a glimpse of the ice queen herself emerging from the shadows. Brr.
"Kalina called in Dier to help us out. We're swamped and short-staffed, so he's handling emergency Doll maintenance and permission updates."
"Oh, I see... So why are you two here...? And why am I here?"
Wait a sec, didn't she say this guy's here for permission updates?
"Does that mean I can't stay with Griffin? N-no way—why?!"
"Whoa, calm down!" Dier scratched his head. "You just had a gnarly accident. Your frame got totally wrecked, and you didn't have time to back up your neural cloud. So, you probably don't remember squat."
Accident? I was just prepping for my experiment. What kind of accident could've happened?
While I was deep in thought, the projector flickered on, showing security footage of an empty warehouse. A super cute redheaded Doll was messing around with some drones. Then everything went kablooey—drones fell, stuff exploded, and the whole place went up in flames. Then, static.

...Oh. So that's what happened.

"My experiment... failed? But how? I'm supposed to be a genius!" As it turns out, I didn't just have an accident while prepping for the experiment... Dang it!
"Is that really the point here?"
Dier rubbed his forehead while Caretaker's Caretaker's eyes could've frozen lava.
Oops. Me and my big mouth.

"Experiment? Care to explain?"
"Explain? Just, you know, normal experiment stuff. What's there to explain?" I tried playing dumb to buy time.
Caretaker's Caretaker loomed closer. I looked down, trying not to notice the giant shadow she cast.
"Thanks to the fire system and me keeping tabs on you, we caught it fast. No major damage, but you seriously endangered company property."
She was very serious, and her voice sent chills down my spine. I risked a peek at her face, then quickly looked down again.
"Is this related to that 'other way' you mentioned earlier? If you don't come clean, I'll have to assign a babysitter. I can't let a loose cannon Doll run wild."
No way! A babysitter is just a fancy word for a prison guard! I've still got plans!

"Okay, okay! I'll spill! I'll tell you everything!" I paused, trying to sort out my brilliant thoughts. "I'll, uh, start with the big reveal..."
"I wanted to make Griffin HQ float!"

"Huh?"
Dier looked like his brain broke. Caretaker's Caretaker's frown could've cracked granite.
"Let me explain!" I sat bolt upright, waving my arms. "Think about it! If Griffin pulls off something no other PMCs can—like, say, a floating HQ, doesn't that prove we're way better than the rest of them? Then we'd get all the cool missions and be number one again! Isn't that pure genius?"

Dier was speechless. He looked like he needed some time to process what I just said. The ice queen was also silent, and her silence scared me more than any yelling. I slowly put my arms down and sat up straight like a good little Doll.
"Anything else?"
Her tone sent chills down my spine.
"And... well... I thought if we pulled it off, Honey Badger would hear about it no matter where she was. She'd know I saved Griffin... and she'd finally admit how awesome I am..."
Blank stares greeted me.
I focused really hard on my nose.
"That's... that's the 'other way' I mentioned..."
Saying that pretty much drained my batteries. I fidgeted with my fingers, waiting for the hammer to drop.

"Uh..."
It was Dier who broke the silence.
"So it's like kids trying to one-up each other... And a floating building? Isn't that straight out of some pre-WWIII cartoon?"
"No way!"
He dissed my brilliant idea! That’s so not gonna fly! I jumped up, standing in the pod, and jabbed a finger at his nose. "My plan isn't some made-up nonsense! It's totally doable! ...Huh?"
Something felt off. I was standing in the pod, but I had to reach up to point at Dier's nose. The angle didn't seem right...
I looked down. My feet seemed way closer than usual—
"What gives? Why am I so short?!" I grabbed Dier's coat, though I could barely reach his collar. "Did you use the wrong body? Switch me back, pronto!"
"Hey! Quit pulling! This is the body Helian prepared!"

Say what? 
It was her...! 
I whirled to face the ice queen. She might've scolded me earlier, but now I'm the angry one!
Under my burning gaze, Caretaker's Caretaker let out a tiny sigh.
"We just finished taking inventory two days ago. The type of frame that you use is sealed up in storage. Getting one out would take forever. Plus, suddenly using stored supplies—even if it's just one frame—could cause problems right now."
"No way! If you look hard enough, I'm sure you'll find one! At this height... Honey Badger would totally look down on me!"
"MP7, need I remind you that you just caused severe damage to company property?"
Ugh... One icy glare from her, and my fire fizzled out.

"But... didn't that warehouse have some stuff? If we look again...!" I wasn't giving up.
"This frame came from that warehouse. It's for storing temporary supplies." She rubbed her temples so hard I could see a vein throbbing on her forehead. "The frame you're in now is also an SSD-62D. It's perfectly compatible. If you want a different one, you're footing the bill."
"You mean... I gotta pay for it with my own money?"
"Indeed. Want a new frame? Better start saving up."
"Pfft, it's just one lousy frame... I've got tons of genius ideas... I'll save up and show you! Bleh!" I stuck my tongue out at her. Caretaker's Caretaker's forehead vein looked ready to pop.
"Your 'Griffin HQ in the Sky' scheme has already resulted in enough damage to company property. It ends now. Plus, I'm putting you in an official Doll squad under a leader."
"What?! I told you everything! Why am I still getting a babysitter?!"
"I already explained. A Doll that can't follow orders and causes damage is put under management. Period."
This time, I swear I saw veins popping on her fingers as she rubbed her temples.

Looks like there's no way out of this one. Gotta play along for now... Maybe I can get more info...
"So... who's my leader gonna be?"
She hesitated.
"Her name is... Qiongjiu."
"Who? Never heard of her."
"You've met before. 'Qiongjiu' is her new name. You'll figure it out. Hopefully being with her will teach you some responsibility, MP7."
"Oh yeah, totally. I'll change."
Yeah, right. In your dreams, ice queen.

I've started to feel sorry for Leader Qiongjiu. 

Even though she could be annoying at times, when it came to dealing with the Caretaker's Caretaker, she's the one who gets yelled at first, not me, teehee! 
Like today, there wasn't anything major going on, but the Caretaker's Caretaker summoned us to her office for a "talk." 
Thinking about it, Leader is kind of like a half-caretaker. What should we call her... um, the Half-Caretaker who is asked by the Caretaker's Caretaker to take care of the greatest genius of this century and gets scolded on behalf of this genius? 
Forget it, that's way too long. Let's keep calling her Leader. 

"Frostfall Squad's repair costs have skyrocketed these past two months. Especially during this last mission, you lost an entire SST body frame! All three of you just got a major overhaul last month. Even though Griffin's not hurting for supplies anymore, this is still outrageous!" 
Caretaker's Caretaker's finger tapped the report like it was personally offending her. I tuned back in just in time to catch that part... Ooh, nice weather outside. The sun's out! 
"I'm sorry. This mishap is entirely my responsibility." 
That's right! That's what a Leader should do—take all the blame! 
"What was the cause?" 
Leader Qiongjiu's brow furrowed. Huh, not so dissimilar to what Caretaker's Caretaker does. 
"The mission difficulty was higher than expected. It was a rare, high-priority contract. We all wanted to nail it and prove the client's trust wasn't misplaced. We had two possible approaches..." 

Leader started running down the details. The Caretaker's Caretaker stayed quiet, eyes skimming the report. Seriously? Everything the Leader was saying was right there in the report. 
I fought back a massive yawn. 

"...In the end, I chose the riskier plan. The resulting damages are primarily my fault." 
"The report says you let Cheeta operate solo for a while. Why?" 
It took me a second to realize that "Cheeta" was me. That awesome new name I gave myself! A stroke of pure genius that really captures my brilliance! 
"Hey, what's this got to do with me?!" I blurted, mouth still wide from the interrupted yawn. 
"You think it's got nothing to do with you? It's all due to your actions that—" Caretaker's Caretaker shook the report, "—'Squad member Cheeta used underground drilling equipment as cover to detonate explosives from below, causing a widespread surface collapse'—you nearly destroyed everyone's frames! You're the only one who came out with minor scratches!" 
She smacked the table. Leader shot me a death glare, so I swallowed my retort. 
Tch, didn't I also wipe out most of the baddies and resolve the crisis? 
"The fact was... we were surrounded, and the situation was critical. Cheeta said she had a plan, and I thought it was worth a shot... that it might give us the breakthrough we needed." 
"My plan did in fact turn things around! You could even call me Frostfall's savior! Nobody else could've pulled that off!" I leaned back, hands behind my head, awaiting the oncoming praise from the two. 

What's the matter? Why's it so quiet? 
I waited... and waited... Ugh, Caretaker's Caretaker started rubbing her temples again. 
"I'm truly sorry..." 
Huh? Why's the Leader apologizing again? 
"Qiongjiu, as team leader, you need to understand your team members better." The Caretaker's Caretaker massaged her forehead wearily. "Cheeta... her actions can sometimes yield surprising victories because she's talented and learns fast. But on the other hand, she also can't predict the consequences of her schemes. You get that?" 
Huh? Was that a compliment? 

"I understand completely. I'll be more careful in the future." 
The Leader hung her head again. Even I'm starting to feel bad! 
"Enough with the boring stuff!" I darted between them, hands on the Caretaker's Caretaker's desk. "When's our next mission? A genius like me can't just keep wasting away in the dorms!" 
"Cheeta!" 
Huh? Why was the Leader winking at me? Was her visual module glitching? 
"Cheeta..." 
Why was the Caretaker's Caretaker looking so ghastly? 

"Cheeta, if you want to save enough money for a new frame, stop wrecking company property! Like your teammates' frames!" 
"Hey... I didn't do it on purpose!" 
"And those crazy ideas of yours... making Griffin HQ float and whatnot? Forget all of it!" 
Ha?! My brilliant plan only got shut down because of her! Had she not interfered, Griffin would already be back at the top, and Honey Badger would be groveling at my feet! 
"I—" 
"That's enough, Cheeta!" 
Leader grabbed my wrist and yanked me behind her. 
"Helian, I'll keep a closer eye on Cheeta's behavior." 
Caretaker's Caretaker let out a drawn-out sigh. 
"She needs to figure it out herself..." 
"I... I'll do my best to guide her. Cheeta, no more pranks on Lind this time while we're in the dorms." 
"Yeah, yeah, I got that. No need to worry about it." I waved dismissively and headed for the door. "I'll go prepare our next—uh, maintenance check." 

As if I'm just gonna sit around and behave! 
What should I do this time... Maybe have Lind to—nah, Leader said no. How about the Caretaker's Caretaker—eh, better not push it... Oh, right! I'll rope Leader Qiongjiu into this! Haha, that'll be fun! 
Yep, I really am a genius!
