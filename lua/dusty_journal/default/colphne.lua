Sooo~ Is the Commander getting a bit slow this time around? 
I mean, the Commander used to be suuuper sharp about everything, y'know? 
When it came to missions, the Commander would always pick the most bang-for-your-buck option. For battle strategies? The Commander would totally consider everyone's strengths. Even first aid, the Commander's pretty slick at that... Sure, the Commander would miss some itty-bitty details now and then, but that’s still waaay better than your average Joe! 
Like, hello? When a machine goes boom, you're supposed to scram, pronto!

But noooo, the Commander ends up with a big ol' gash on the arm. 
Maybe the Commander is just not feeling it this time? That's why the Commander got hurt? 
Hmm... better keep an extra close eye on the Commander.

So there I am, patching up the Commander's boo-boo, and get this—the Commander has got a face like a powered-down Doll. Zero expression. 
Hmph. I might've tightened that knot juuust a teensy bit more than necessary. 
"Sss—! "The Commander hissed. 
Teehee~ 
After I finished up, the Commander was there twisting their arm around, checking out my handiwork.
And then, the Commander goes and says...

"Colphne's got some pretty nifty bandaging skills. This knot looks quite nice."

Was the Commander just saying that to be nice? 
No, there’s no way—
The Commander's face looked genuinely curious, and their body language wasn’t screaming "I’m faking it".

So, I guess the Commander probably doesn't know about her.

She... she was different from other humans, but she and the Commander, they're kinda similar in some ways.

If only she were still alive... it'd be super great if she were here too.

Today! 
We ran into those Varjagers again! 
Grr—! 
This itty-bitty handgun won't cut it for a real fight! I've gotta, absolutely gotta get some serious firepower to take down those Varjagers! Otherwise, everything up till now would be for nothing! 
If not, me and the others on the "Elmo" are gonna end up just like those guys back then, buried in the sand and forgotten. 
No one's going to remember them, let alone care about them.

If only I could be as cool as Leader Groza... 
No no no, I can't give up on being a "Medical Doll" just yet.

I can totally do this, Anfiya...
...

"Hmm? Not bad with the bandages. This knot looks exactly like the one in the textbook. You really are a medical Doll, huh?" 
"You, what's your name?"

That drawn-out tone, that lazy voice, those blue-gray eyes, and that scar on her right cheek— 
She’s Anfiya Sharapova.
I did a quick search in my neural cloud for info about her. Anfiya Sharapova, Central Army Emergency First Response, 11th Medical and Chemical Regiment, leader of the third medical team where I belong.
How should I respond to all that? 
My database doesn't contain any pre-programmed answers for this kind of conversation. All I can do is respond to that last question.

Smile. Lift lip corners by 30 degrees. Hands behind the back. 
Preset posture, checked.

"Hi, Officer Anfiya Sharapova. I'm a civilian medical Doll, serial number TS-K-2076. How can I help you?" 
"Ha...? TS—what? Why do your naming conventions keep changing?"
"Yes, I'm sorry about that."
"Get a new name."
"Okay, what would you like to call me?"
"What to call you... uh..."
She looked like she was putting in a lot of thought.
"Colphne—Colphne? Hmm, that sounds pretty good," she flipped through her medical records, "The patient with this name just had a successful surgery. I hope this name brings you good luck too."
"Yes, Officer Sharapova, I'm Colphne!" 
And that's how I got my very own name.

I never thought she'd come looking for me again. 
Or that she'd curse someone out like that. Her words were so harsh, she used pretty much every string of vocabulary in my database that I cannot say to my patients. 
While I was wondering if I should report this to the higher-ups, she grabbed my arm. "Colphne, right? Come on! Let's go for a walk!" 
She put on a protective suit and dragged me to the top of a ruined building next to the barracks. There being no Collapse storm that day, visibility was over 10 kilometers. She sat there, spacing out, not uttering a single word.
She stared at the ruins in the distance, and I stared at her. 
We were quiet for a long time.

"Why are you staring at me like that? Did you crash or something?" 
My body was perfectly functional, so I didn't get where she was coming from.
"Anfiya, we'll see the light together, please don't give up."
I changed the way I addressed her and used the nicest words from my pre-programmed vocabulary. Maybe that's the right thing to say? 
"Cut that scripted nonsense! I'm the one who wrote the medical Doll’s response library. If you're gonna talk, use your own words!" 
Looks like she got mad. 
"Anfiya, please don't be angry, everything will be alright." 
She whipped her head around and glared at me. After a while, she let out a cold "hmph".
"Shut up, Colphne."
"Yes, Anfiya."
I answered. 
She glared at me again, then clammed up. Then, she pulled out a cigarette and a lighter, clicked it a bunch of times all grumpily, but no blue flame showed up as anticipated.
"What a bummer." 
She then tossed the lighter into the sand.

"Anfiya, smoking is bad for you, so please..." 
Before I could finish, she shoved something hard into my hand. According to my visual feedback system, it was half a chocolate bar in a torn wrapper.

"Thank you, Anfiya. I don't need chocolate, Anfiya."
"Just take it. Pop it in your mouth when you want to talk."
"Consuming food will cause a number of problems to Dolls, like—"
"Put it in your mouth, NOW."

I hesitated for a second, then followed her order and popped the chocolate in my mouth.

"How's it taste?" 
She asked. Her eyes were all smiles, the corners of her mouth lifted up by more than 30 degrees; beholding an expression that could definitely be categorized as "happy".
My programming told me I should've said...

"The Dolls in the third medical team don't have taste modules." 
No, maybe a different answer would be better. 
Searching in my neural cloud for what chocolate should taste like— 
"Anfiya, it's sweet and super tasty."

She burst out laughing. I could almost see her back teeth through her protective suit's mask.
If she liked chocolate, I had to remind her to brush her teeth.
"You're funny, really funny." she laughed as she patted my shoulder, "A Doll that lies, that's hilarious!"
"If I can make Anfiya happy, then I'm happy too."
That wasn't a pre-programmed response. Those words came together on their own and popped out of my mouth. 
"Oho~" 
She looked at me all surprised, then started laughing again. 
She looked so pretty when she laughed, I thought.

Weather: Severe Collapse Storm
Mood: ^_^

I just want to see her smile forever and ever.
Back then, she was smiling too.

Another day with that nasty Collapse storm going wild, everyone's hiding in camp. Anfiya's all smiles, saying we've saved 48 people so far, and that we'll be outta here soon for our next rescue mission.
At first, when we were deciding whether to save those folks with early E.L.I.D. symptoms from the Collapse storm, Anfiya got into a big argument with one of the team members.
But in the end, Anfiya convinced everyone.
"We're going to save these infected people, we've got plenty of supplies."
"Doesn't matter where they're from, a life's a life. I don't want to hear any more objections."
The arguing stopped, it got all quiet, and everyone just stared at Anfiya.
This might not be good. My programming says humans need support.

"I support Anfiya!"
I said, jumping up, smiling real big, and raising my hand up high.
People around me started grumbling, but she stood there in the crowd, smiling at me.
As a medical team, saving lives is our number one priority.
There are some weird feelings building in my neural cloud.
I don’t understand.

We ended up taking in those patients, giving them treatment. It all went super smooth.
Then, October 14th, 2073 rolled around.
Just another day with another Collapse storm, nothing special. Anfiya was asking me how to tie the perfect bandage knot, like always.
But then, we heard gunshots outside. Sand full of Collapse radiation from the Yellow Zone came rushing into the camp, and along with it our team members with bloodied chests.
"It's the Varjagers... Run! Run!"
Judging by his voice, his lungs were all clogged up, with fluid building in his chest. He needed treatment, stat.
He fell over in front of us, coughing like crazy, and then the gunshots got even louder and more frequent.

...

Someone grabbed my hand really tight. I could feel the warmth of a human, and the sticky blood where our skin touched.
It didn't hurt, but I could tell how strong they were.
Running away, following their steps, I heard Anfiya’s heavy breaths.
"Anfiya, you've lost more than 10% of your blood! You need treatment right now!"
"Cough, cough—! Shut up! Get in!"

She shoved me into the jeep, holding the door with one hand and pushing me down into the driver's seat with the other.
"My name is Anfiya Sharapova. Seal all exits, lock the windows, start the autopilot, and keep going forward. Don't accept any other commands!"
As soon as she finished, we heard those people's voices and more gunshots.
"Anfiya, get in the jeep! You'll die if you keep bleeding!"
I grabbed her arm as hard as I could, trying to pull her into the jeep.
"Shut up, Colphne! Stay alive!"
She shouted, then yanked her arm away, pushed me down onto the seat, and finally slammed the door shut.
I could see the Varjagers catching up.
Gunshots rang out, and Anfiya fell right in front of me.

ANFIYA——!
Why, why, why, why, WHY?!

"Stop! Stop, please! STOP——!"
I screamed, but the only response I got was "Insufficient authorization," over and over. I slumped over the steering wheel, with nothing but a sandstorm in front of me.
I can't... I can't just leave her there! If I go back now, maybe I can still save her!
I hit the jeep's window as hard as I could. I don't know how long it took, but I finally crawled out.
I ran towards where she fell.

Yellow sand, endless yellow sand.
I couldn't see Anfiya or anyone else. All I could see was the camp, completely looted by the Varjagers.
Everything was quiet.

I failed.
I didn't make it in time.
Anfiya, she's... gone.
No humans, dead, vanished, I should be sad, I should cry, I should, I should...
No, no, nonononono.
Save her!
I should save her!
I remember where people live nearby. With just some medical supplies and some help, I can come back and save her.
40km, that's not far, Anfiya, just wait a little longer for me.

...

"Huh? There's not even a shadow of anyone. They must've been swept away by the Collapse storm."
"No point in trying to save them. We're short on supplies too. Let's get outta here."
"But... Anfiya..."
"How many people die in the contamination zone every day? We don't have time for this."
"Please, I'm begging you..."

Smile. Lift those corners of your mouth up 30 degrees. Put your hands behind your back.
Gotta smile, gotta smile, that's what humans want to see. If they see me smiling, maybe they'll help save Anfiya.

"Huh? You weirdo, your smile's uglier than you crying."
"You look pretty pitiful, but give it up. The protective suit's busted, and no one survives where the Collapse storm hits, especially since your 'Anfiya' was hurt."

I knew they wouldn't give me supplies or help save Anfiya. But if they could give—no, lend me some communication device—
"I-If possible, can I use your communication equipment? I... I can help treat patients, get groundwater, even fix houses..."
My voice was shaking.
"Oh right, you're a medical model, aren't you?"
"Y-Yes, sir."
"Fix up the person inside, and I'll lend you the communicator."

...

Lucky for me, the person's injuries weren't too bad. Under their watchful eyes, I used the medical kit they gave me and gained access to the communicator.
I searched my database for the Central Army emergency reporting channel.
Connection made.
"This is medical Doll TS-K-2076 from the 11th Medical and Chemical Regiment of the Central Army Emergency First Response. The 3rd Medical Team was attacked by Varjagers while on a mission. The situation is critical, requesting immediate assistance!"
After what felt like an eternity a robot voice told me they got the message, and ordered me to get back to my team.
Then, they hung up.

...

Why, why did it turn out like this?
I kept trying to call back. At first, they answered in a grumpy tone, but afterwards only busy tones played.

"We've recorded the incident—you don't have the clearance to receive updates, please stop calling."
I gave back the communicator, and for some reason, I felt something strange and new budding within.
I started running.
Colphne. Run, run faster, faster.
Run to where she used to be, where she made me leave.
My hands dug into the yellow sand, trying to find even the tiniest trace of her.

Nothing.
No matter how many times I tried, there was nothing. Just yellow sand slipping through my fingers.
The sand, it's so annoying.
The wind, it's so annoying too!
Why is it that I can only kneel? Why is it that my hands can only hold these useless grains of sand?!

Anfiya...
If she hadn't saved me and escaped in the car instead, would things be different now?
If I could've run a bit faster and made it back to save her, would things be different now?
Back then, if she hadn't tried to save those people, would things be different now?
There will never be answers.
There will never be a reality I live in where those ’ifs’ are real.

I stood up, not knowing where to go. But I couldn't just give up.
She said, "Stay alive, Colphne."
So I have to survive. Survive until I take care of those Varjager bastards. Then, I'll come back here to be with you... Anfiya.
They say that when humans die, their souls go to Heaven.
Dolls don't have souls, but I have a neural cloud backup. As long as my neural cloud data is okay, I can avenge you.

My self-diagnostic program says I've only got enough energy for two more days.
Energy, that's what I need the most right now. Just a little bit... a tiny bit. This is a contamination zone; humans really need medical help. Trading medical aid for electricity shouldn't be a problem.
Broken human bodies, bleeding wounds, and painful curses... Dealing with stuff like that is my job.

"Your name's Colphne, right? Cough, cough... You look really cute..."
"Thank you very much."
The programmed response just popped out of my mouth, but why'd they call me cute?
"If my daughter were alive today, she'd be about your age."
"...Please believe, as long as you don't give up, the future will be bright."
"Cough, cough... Heh, see that person outside? Once you fix us all up, they'll take you apart and sell you to some shady dealer."
My hands tightened, and the human in front of me gasped.
"Sorry..."
"You're just like a human... Run away, Colphne."
"Why... are you telling me this?"
"Without you, I probably wouldn’t make it through this month."

...

I ran away.
I ran far, far away from there.
Step by step, my self-diagnostic system kept throwing errors at me.
"Low-power mode on."
I gave this command to my body, and everything went dark.
Turn off the journal entry module?
"...Keep it on."

I have to survive.
Explosions, people screaming, bullets hitting metal, that's mostly what I remember about the battlefield—

When the fighting starts, hide.
When it's over, go search. If I find one energy cell, I can keep going for a few more days.
My hands were digging through mechanical parts when something pierced the fake muscles in my hand. I lifted my right hand.
Tissue fluid gushed out, hitting the broken metal with a ticking sound.
It's okay.
A quick stitch, keep searching.

"Who's there?!"
A scared, unfamiliar voice came from nearby.
Being in low-power mode, I could only see a fuzzy, hunched shadow.
They seemed to be holding a gun, a... big but blurry gun.
"..."
I quietly stepped back, clutching the energy cell I'd just found.
The shadow moved—they were aiming—
Run!
My legs moved faster than my neural cloud could process, and I ran through the wreckage.
"Bang!"
The gunshot was deafening. The bullet tore through my back and got stuck in my chest.
I feel like I'm on fire. But I can't fall here.
The gunshots didn't stop. I ran with all my might until my body couldn't take it anymore, and my artificial muscles started falling off.
I collapsed in a ruined building in the Yellow Zone.

Anfiya, it's so dark here...
But I haven't avenged you yet. I can't come and see you yet...
Humans can feel the cold; is this what the cold feels like?
Anfiya...

Time no longer made sense to me.
I don't know how long it has been, but a tall, dark figure stopped in front of me.
"A Doll from the Central Army? Looks like I caught a little wolf cub stranded in the storm... Wow~"
Battery depleted, visual module shutting down.

My body can move again.
I opened my eyes and saw this lady watching me like a hawk with her arms crossed.
Her hair was all black, and her eyes were ice cold. What I felt from her wasn’t what I deemed "human".
She wasn’t a "human", like Anfiya was.

"..."
I took a little step back, keeping my eyes on her. I need to be able to run if things go bad.
"Hmm~? Aren't you a cautious little thing? That's pretty rare~"
"I did some digging. You're one of those Dolls from the 11th Medical and Chemical Regiment, right? How much do you know about what happened to them a few months back?"
"...Did you fix me up?"
"Oh?" She smiled all interested-like. "Not gonna answer my question, huh? Asking your own instead?"
"Put an FCC in me, make me a T-Doll, and I'll spill the beans about the 11th," I said.
"Huh? Little wolf cub, do you even know what you're saying? Do you have any idea how much moolah it took to drag you back here and get you up and running?"
"I don't think you've got any useful information, little cub."
Poludnitsa kept on smiling.
"Wanna bet I'll take you apart right now?"
"T-Take me apart...? But didn't you just..."
That smile of hers was totally different from Anfiya’s.
That smile of hers— 
Was a fake one; only used in the presence of those one has little patience for.

So I took another step back.

"Oh~ Finally catching on, are we? I'm not exactly... what you'd call a good person, little cub." 
Her face looked just like those I had once seen, who wanted to tear me apart and sell the parts off. Maybe I should make a run for it... 
"With that posture of yours... you thinking of running?" She still looked as aloof as ever and showed no signs she was going to attack. I just stared at her, keeping my mouth zipped. 
"I went through all this trouble to wake you up, and you haven't given me a single juicy bit of info. Instead, you're trying to bargain with me..."
She paused, her smile growing ever bigger. 
"So, pray tell, why should I let you keep on existing...?"

Her words sent a chill down my spine; a feeling not too far removed from when I was shot in the back. This lady, she can totally do what she's saying! 
To stay alive, I’ve got to do what I did before... 
"You want to know about the 11th Medical and Chemical Regiment, right? I-I can tell you everything!" 
She squinted her eyes and gave a little smile. 
"What else~?" 
"And... and... whatever you want to know! I'll spill everything! Just... just let me keep on living!" 
She kept squinting at me, not saying a peep. 
Gotta say something to make her believe me, or I'll end up like before— 
"You can have all the info about the regiment... and whatever services I am capable of! Medical rescue work, cleaning, I can do it all!" 
She still didn't say anything, but her eyes grew a bit softer. Maybe... maybe I can ask for something now? 
"I just need a tiny bit of electricity to stay alive!"

She kept staring at me, then suddenly burst out laughing. 
"Not a bad deal, kid. I'm Poludnitsa. You are...?" 
"Col-Colphne." 
"Hm? That's not a medical Doll's serial number. Who gave you that name?" 
"..." 
"Not gonna answer? Well, that's fine." 
She paused and raised an eyebrow. 
"Colphne, lemme tell you something. When dealing with 'humans', the 'Mona Lisa smile' is your best bet~ And your tone should be all warm and fuzzy~" 
"Mona... Mona Lisa smile? What's that...?" 
"At the very least, you need to convince me that you're trustworthy~"
"Warm, trustworthy... I-I get it." 
I smiled super wide, trying to sound as warm as possible— 
"Whatever Poludnitsa asks for, no matter what it is, I'll do it for sure~" 
"Oh...? Haha~" 
Poludnitsa laughed. 
"A-Am I doing it right? Poludnitsa?" 
"...Yeah, that’s not bad at all."

After that, I got enough electricity to stay alive from Poludnitsa by doing medical work and odd jobs. She started being nicer to me, though sometimes she'd make this weird scowl. 
Sometimes, Poludnitsa would chat about the contamination zone. 
But just living on isn’t enough for me. 
My real goal is to avenge Anfiya.

One time, while I was helping with the stock-taking, I spotted Poludnitsa and zoomed over to her. 
"Poludnitsa~ I'm back again~ Got any new tasks for me? I've been waiting soooo impatiently~" 
"You again? Colphne, right? You want me to install that fire-control core, don't you? Getting impatient, huh?" 
"Ah, as expected of Poludnitsa, you saw right through me~ Since you know, pretty please help me out~ I've been working super duper hard lately~" 
"Oh? What have you been up to? Let's see..." 
Poludnitsa flipped through her logs. 
"Pulling shifts, sweeping, laundry, organizing supplies... that's it? Colphne, I could get any old Doll to do these chores." 
My smile froze, but I quickly plastered it back on.
"But... but I really, really need this fire-control core..." 
"Well, let me give it to you straight, little cub. It's not happening~" 
Same answer again. But I can't give up. 
"Okay then, Poludnitsa, I'll come back to see you tomorrow~" 
"Huh? Tomorrow?" 
Poludnitsa sighed. 
"Feels like you've been here forever. I've put up with you long enough." 
"...Ah, not at all~" 
I took a deep breath and put on my best ’Mona Lisa smile’. 
"No matter how long it takes, I just wanna help Poludnitsa more and more~" 
Poludnitsa's face twisted into that familiar scowl.

"Come to think of it... there's someone who really likes to stick their nose in this kinda business~"
"Someone... who?" 
"That person has this huge MCV called the Elmo~" 
"T-The Elmo...?"

Poludnitsa looked up as she walked down memory lane. 
"Ha~ It was a while back. Met this person by chance, during this really unusual snowstorm. Their MCV was all busted up, and there was this blue-white flash over it, like some kind of legendary, unfathomable spontaneous combustion. Elmo... someone with a big responsibility... and that very phenomenon is literally known as the St. Elmo's fire—"
"Snow in the contamination zone, thunder, and spontaneous combustion on the vehicle roof. What were the chances, eh...?"
"This person driving an MCV called the Elmo—don't you think it's like, destiny or something?"

I didn't really get what she was saying. 
But right now, I was focused on something else.

"So... can I go to the Elmo?" 
"Now that's a whole ’nother can of worms~ There are so many rooms on board the Elmo, it's like a maze. Well, if you sneak in and stay hidden, it probably won't be a big deal."
"What if I get caught...?"

She seemed to remember something and grinned wolfishly. 
"If you get caught, just talk to that person using—yeah, the 'Mona Lisa voice'. That person's like, a rare good egg in the contamination zone, and pretty generous too. They'll probably agree to let you stay. Oh~ I do wish they'd stop calling me 'Harpagon'." 
"The Elmo is manned by a whole bunch of T-Dolls, the kind you wanna be. If you can sweet-talk that person, you might just get what you want. And then, you can get outta my hair faster."

That person...

Looking at Poludnitsa's face, I made up my mind.

"So, Poludnitsa, can you pretty please send me to that person~?" 
I gave her my cutest smile, the kind most people would call adorable. Poludnitsa smiled back. 
"Well, let's see—" 
She pointed at a black box in the base. 
"As it just so happens, I'm missing a few parts, totaling at about your weight. If you wanna go, just hop into this box."

It's super dark in this box. 
My body is trembling a little. 
I have no clue how much time has passed, but I can hear the sound of conversation outside. 
Sounds like they're having a big argument over something. One of them has a voice that can only be described as special. That voice is approaching. They seem to be... coming over to open this box.
I see a glimmer of light upon their opening of this box.

W–What should I say first to make these strangers believe in me? 
To make that person Poludnitsa talked about trust me?
Poludnitsa said that person is a Commander of many Dolls, so... can I call them... Commander too? 
The footsteps are getting closer, and then— 
Alarms start blaring. The footsteps stop and move away. 
I let out a big breath and made sure it was all quiet before I lifted the lid and crawled out of the box.

This place doesn't seem to be much better than Poludnitsa's. 
I snuck over to where I heard noise, and gently pressed my ear against the sliding door, trying to catch every little word. 
Suddenly, the door flies open and I fall to the floor. 
I look up, and with the ear-piercing alarm still going off, I see a bunch of pitch-black gun barrels pointed right at me.

I need to show them that I have no intention to attack. 
Still sprawled on the floor, I put on a smile. "Whoa... Sorry, I didn't know there were people around!"
No reply.
That person who seems to be the 'Commander' stared at me. 
"...Who are you?"

...

I've been here for a long time now. 
Even though I was retrofitted with an FCC, it's still not enough. 
I'm nowhere near strong enough to erase the Varjagers. I need more power. 
I'll remain here for now.

...

"Colphne, what are you thinking about? You look like you’ve been spirited away."
"Oh, nothing much~ By the way, Commander, you gotta be more careful next time. Can't have you... getting all banged up, okay?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
The person in front of me rotated their wrist around, checking out the knot I tied. 
"It's pretty, but something feels... off."
"Off—? Ohhh, I get it! Let me fix it up for you right now—Commander~"
"...Colphne, don’t talk like that."
The person in front of me looks fed up, just like... just like how Anfiya once reacted. 
The Commander is a good person. 
A good person, like Anfiya was. 
Good people should live on. 
I took a deep breath, quickly grabbed the Commander's arm, undid the bandage, and tied the messiest knot ever. 
Just like the ones Anfiya used to tie.

"Colphne..."
"There! Did I do a suuuper good job fixing it for you, Commander~?" 
I asked with a smile.

Maybe, just maybe, this person can really be trusted. 
Looks like I'll be interacting with them for a while longer... 
Only time will tell.
