Time: Day ■■
Status: In Progress

It is now 10:26 p.m... The team has just finished the most crucial part of the mission—rescuing the client's target from the enemy and reaching the designated spot to wait for the pick-up crew.
The designated spot is a bar, half-hidden underground in the Green Zone. The path to the entrance is winding and tricky. Without the map provided by the client, this place would be as hard to find as a lone star in the universe.
Inside the bar, there's a red-haired hostess who smells like peach perfume, as if she stepped out of an old sci-fi movie. Her eyes are full of wrinkles, and she's quite old. We had to wait for a bit before finally meeting her.

After arriving here by helicopter, we protected Willers Finn, who had just escaped from danger and was still in shock. We confirmed the meeting location based on the 3D map sent by the client—the mist after the rain had not yet cleared, lightly veiling the entrance to the underground bar.
The wooden sign was old and gray, and the water stains hadn't dried yet.
Grizzly double-checked the address but still had doubts. The bar's entrance faced a private mansion. What used to be the mansion's back door was now sealed with cement, and you could only vaguely tell there used to be a door there. The layout was really strange, and the team couldn't help but discuss it.

I noticed that if I walked a dozen steps along the path, I could climb up the stairs to the public balcony of an abandoned building. Looking west from there, it was the best place to stargaze at night. Before I could think further, a voice came from the door of the bar.
"Who are you?"
The voice of a young girl, sounding no older than 20.
"I'll have a cold fragrant cigar," Grizzly said.
Cold fragrant cigar, the code given by the client. Finn's gray trench coat smelled of tobacco. It was referring to him.
"Please wait."
The girl peeked at us through the narrow gap in the door, waited for a moment, and then slowly opened the iron door.

"I'm Claire. Sorry, we have to most accountable for our customers. Mr. Greenwood has reserved a location for you. Please, follow me."
The girl had unforgettable red hair, with a seashell hair ornament on her bun. Various marine creatures were perched on the narrow shells, and a circle of gold lines was printed on the edge. She was completely different from the young girls I had seen—she was a Doll, had her own name, and was quite favored by her owner.
We followed her into the bar, which wasn't very big and was filled with a faint smell of hops, slightly astringent, like malt liquor that wasn't fully foamed. I looked around, and there wasn't a single customer—only some dim lights.

"Please wait a moment, the hostess will be here soon."
As soon as she finished speaking, a small door next to her opened, and a red-haired woman with the same exquisite seashell hair ornament walked out.
"Claire, get some drinks for our guests. Welcome. Greenwood has told me about you, and I've prepared a suitable place for you to rest."
The woman flashed a slightly tired smile and led us to a small room, saying as she walked, "Mr. Greenwood told me that the support team he sent will probably—" She glanced at her watch, "Hmm, arrive in about an hour."

The room was warm, and the dry wood hadn't been touched by the rain. The woman didn't say much, and after exchanging a few polite words with Grizzly, she left. Finn sat down awkwardly, straightening his wrinkled gray pinstripe shirt, while M590 and Grizzly sat across from him, fully relaxed.
There were a few cans of beer on the reddish-brown coffee table. PzB39 grabbed one, popped the tab, and handed it to me.
"...Thanks, PzB."
I like beer. That's thanks to Griffin mechanic, who maintains my gastral module.

I took the beer and my gaze drifted outside.
The mist had cleared, and the rain-washed night sky was as clean as black velvet, with stars like scattered diamonds shining in a specific pattern.
The window was half-open, and my gaze passed through the wooden frame, settling on the soft night sky.

"Leader, I'm stepping out for a bit. I'll be back in 15 minutes."
Grizzly nodded. I checked my camera and headed for the door. M82 followed me.
"M82, why are you suddenly..."
"I want to see the stars too! Tonight's perfect for stargazing!"
"But you didn't bring your camera."
"It's beautiful, even if you just look at it with your own eyes! And I want to see it with you."
"...Okay."
I led her around the haphazardly placed tables and chairs, heading to the bar's entrance. We stepped outside. Not far from there, there was an empty house... Yeah, right there.
M82 and I walked towards the house together.
"Alfa, every time we go on a mission, you always find the best spots for stargazing. How do you do it?"
I felt a bit shy and whispered, "If you want to see the stars, you obviously have to seek the best spot."

We stood on the balcony with the refreshing night breeze on our backs. The starry sky seen through the window was already stunning, but now, standing up high, it looked even more breathtaking.
I instinctively raised my camera, adjusted the aperture and focus, and snapped picture after picture.
"Alfa, you're the only one who takes pictures of stars while on a mission. After we rescued Finn earlier, everyone's batteries were almost dead. I thought you'd be resting like Grizzly and the others."
I put down the camera and gazed up at the starry sky.

"A night sky like this is so rare, I have to capture the moment. But what's even rarer is the transit of Mercury happening this year. I've even set a digital reminder for it. According to the forecast from the Cerro Tololo Observatory..."
Before I could finish, M82 interrupted me with a laugh.
"Here we go again! I've heard you talk about this Mercury transit so many times, my ears are getting calluses! Wait, do Dolls get calluses? Maybe? Maybe not..."
"This kind of a celestial event is a once-in-a-century thing. If we're lucky, we might even see an Einstein ring, with a bright halo surrounding a lone star. Wouldn’t that be magnificent and beautiful?"
"Magnificent and beautiful? Hmm, didn't 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' mention something like that..."
M82 laughed and started talking about a sci-fi novel we both love. I couldn't help but smile. Her voice and the way she talked made me feel at peace.

But that peace was soon broken. It was broken by the notice sent to all Dolls about the disbanding and reorganization of Griffin.
I had sighed in sadness but wasn't too surprised. When Griffin was in turmoil and the Commander left, I had a feeling this moment would come. No matter how reluctant we are, there will always be a time to part... I just didn't expect it to come so suddenly.
"Alfa, how can you be so calm! Griffin is going to disband and reorganize!"
"Yeah... but it can't be helped. Since it can't be helped, what's the point of getting excited or anxious?"
"You... You're such a blockhead! We have no way of controlling it, but we should at least think about our future! Wait, Leader sent a message. She wants us to go back quickly—must be something to do with this." M82 tugged at my sleeve.
I sighed, "Give me a minute, there's another to take."
"Hurry up!"

Following M82's urging, we went back to that cramped room. M82 and I sat across from Grizzly and Finn, while M590 and PzB39 sat next to Finn.
The gray-haired young man was surrounded by a bunch of Dolls, looking extremely uncomfortable.
"What are you going to do?"
"Ensure your safety. Also, we're going to have a quick meeting—don't worry, we have our own communication channels, so even though we're in the same room, we won't disturb you," Grizzly said. Then, all of us received a message on Level II—
"Griffin is about to disband and reorganize, and everyone needs to think about their future. Dolls can apply to stay in Griffin, but there is a very limited number of positions. Alternatively, they can accept resettlement to work in the Green Zones, where there are more jobs available. Personally, I think Squad Grizzly should stick together no matter where we end up. What do you all think?"
M590's message popped up quickly.
M590: I fully support the Leader's decision. As for where to go—well, although I’d hate to leave Griffin, it would probably be tough for all of us to stay there, right? So why not go along with resettlement and find a job in a Green Zone? Depending on the city's security level we might have to remove our fire-control cores, but in the Green Zones, we won't have to engage in combat, so it doesn't really matter if we don't have them.
M82: I agree. I heard some Green Zones have libraries. I wonder if Dolls can work as librarians.
PzB39: I want to keep working on my motorbike. There should be auto repair shops in the Green Zones, right?
Grizzly: So, everyone wants to go to the Green Zone?
M590: Anywhere is fine, as long as we're together.
PzB39: Exactly. Once my motorbike is ready, I'll take everyone for a ride. I'm just not sure if we can all get assigned to the same company... But if we talk to Helian in advance, maybe we'd have a chance?"
...
My teammates' voices echoed through Level II. Soon, the topic shifted the Commander who had left a long time ago.
Grizzly: How do you think the Commander felt when leaving Griffin? The contamination zone is so dangerous, and the Commander left alone, unlike us who still have one another to rely on...
M590: The Commander has always been decisive. There must have been a reason for them choosing to leave.
M82: Yeah... I hope the Commander can achieve everything they want. Even if they're no longer with Griffin, the Commander is still the Commander.
PzB39: Cheer up, the Commander is resourceful. Unlike us Dolls who worry about battles in Griffin and survival after leaving, maybe the Commander is doing better than us now!
M590: Don't be ridiculous. If it weren't for this disbandment and reorganization, which Doll in her right mind would want to leave Griffin? But... the positions in Griffin and the Green Zone are limited, so we should apply early.
Grizzly: Yeah, if we do well in the Green Zone, maybe we can save up some money and go find the Commander!
...

Realizing that I had been keeping silent, Grizzly asked me directly.
Grizzly: What about you, Alfa? Do you want to join us?
M82: Squad Grizzly can't be split up!
M590: Yeah, Alfa!
PzB39: How about I put a really tall rack on the motorbike just for you to watch the stars, Alfa?
...
I sighed softly and gave my answer.
AK-Alfa: As long as I can see the stars and catch this year's transit of Mercury, I can go anywhere.
M82: What? That's such a cold response!
PzB39: Yeah, Alfa, sometimes you need to be more open. Wouldn't it be nice for all of us to go for a ride together?
...
My teammates whined and pouted, making me feel a bit helpless.
AK-Alfa: As long as we go to the Green Zone, I'll be with everyone, right? No need to spell it out.
M82: Of course you need to spell it out! How else will everyone know what you're really thinking?

AK-Alfa: ...
...
The conversation didn't last long before we heard gunshots outside.

As soon as the gunshots rang out, the red-haired woman quickly pushed open the door and yelled that we were under attack. Finn's face suddenly went pale, and he told us that his brother might have bribed our contact to silence him. Grizzly immediately rallied the squad, and everyone prepared for battle.
Seeing everyone with their guns at the ready, I couldn't help but think that if we all became ordinary Dolls in the future, we would all have our fire-control cores removed, and this could very well be our very last battle together.
But for me, it didn't matter where I went, as long as I could see the stars. That's truly how I felt.
After becoming ordinary Dolls with no fire-control cores, the city we served would probably offer us protection. After all, many Dolls in the local workforce possessed no combat capabilities to begin with. 

But when the enemy forces flooded into the bar and started shooting indiscriminately, aiming to take out Finn as quickly as possible, I changed my mind.

"Help, Claire, help me!" the red-haired woman screamed at the top of her lungs. M82 took down two enemies closing in on her, but it still couldn't slow the enemy's advance. The next moment, Claire burst out with a submachine gun.
But before Claire could even fire, a barrage of bullets hit her squarely in the head. Her delicate shell hairpin was shattered in the chaos.
"Claire!" the red-haired woman screamed even louder.
Claire fell to the ground, unable to move. There were several round black bullet holes on her forehead, leaving some of her circuits exposed and sparking. With no consciousness behind her eyes, they looked blank and powerless. No matter how desperately the red-haired woman called out, Claire wouldn't respond. The submachine gun lay next to her, having not fired a single bullet.
"..."
The Doll without a fire-control core was damaged beyond repair before she could even fire.
If Squad Grizzly accepted reassignment and went to the Green Zone as ordinary Dolls, would we also end up like this?
...

"Alfa, we're still in combat! What are you spacing out for?!"
M82's stern voice snapped me back to the battlefield.
"Don't worry, everyone. I just called for support. Griffin reinforcements will be here in ten minutes."
"Mr. Finn, don't be so scared. Even if your contact has turned on us, Squad Grizzly will escort you to safety. Just remember to leave us a good review!"
...
My teammates were still relaxed and unperturbed. No one seemed bothered by what just happened, except for me.

Ten minutes later, Griffin's elite team arrived as promised. The leader, WA2000, swiftly and decisively wiped out all the enemies with overwhelming firepower. PzB39 couldn't help but exclaim, "Such strength, are you kidding me? They took down those tough enemies in just a few minutes."
"If they had arrived a few minutes earlier, the Doll named Claire wouldn't have met her end like that," I muttered.
"There's nothing we could do about it. Who knew the contact would sell us out? Regular Dolls can take out a thug or two at best. She just got unlucky in this situation."
I would admit that such an attack was statistically unlikely to happen, but it did happen. Didn't this prove that the Green Zone wasn't as safe as Grizzly and her team thought?

In the end, Grizzly passed the case over to the support team and asked them to take Finn to a safe location. She would contact the client later and discuss their next steps. While Grizzly was briefing the support team, I quietly walked up to the red-haired woman. Her face was stained with tears.
"What are you going to do with her?"
I pointed down at Claire.
"I've uploaded her neural data to the server in advance, and Greenwood will pay for a new frame."
"Do all shop owners back up their Dolls' neural clouds like you?"
"Not really... After all, renting a server is not exactly cheap, but Claire is very important to me..."
I stumbled backward.
"In other words, to other shop owners, Dolls are likely just tools and consumables..." 
The woman said nothing to that and just looked sadly at the Doll's broken body. She cherished this Doll so much and even gave her a name, but when faced with danger, she still commanded the Doll to protect her, despite the Doll's lack of combat capability.
If Grizzly and the others were to encounter such a situation in the future... 

"Alfa, get ready. We should head back. Hey, how come you're falling behind again?!" 
"On it." 
After responding to Grizzly, I silently left the red-haired woman's side.
The Doll's empty eyes kept staring at me, as if in silent warning.
The Green Zone was really not as safe as Grizzly and the others imagined. Not every human who hired Dolls would treat us as well as the Commander.

Soon, we all boarded the helicopter and prepared to return to Griffin.
As we left, the thin veil of mist covering the city had faded, and the cityscape gradually came into full view. The propellers started up, and all the details of the city started blending into small patches of color, until everything just became a blur.
Squad Grizzly could find themselves living in a city such as this.
Do they truly understand what the future had in store for them? If we stayed with Griffin, we would obviously have to be constantly prepared for battle, but would it be any better to be without a fire-control core and thus utterly defenseless when in danger? That said, the cities in the Green Zone did have their own charms—
Libraries with endless collections of books, where you could find the rarest sci-fi novels; auto repair shops where you could learn any modification technique...
Or maybe... they just don't want to be separated.
The Dolls in Squad Grizzly have always known their own minds.

Even I—
I love the green fields in the Green Zone and the sky above them after the rain. The sky is as clean and clear as an unpolluted deep spring, where all kinds of rare astronomical phenomena can appear, and one can take photos of the most magnificent starry sky.
Countless thoughts intertwined in my mind. Eventually, I lightly tapped PzB39, who was sitting next to me and having a lively conversation with M590, on the shoulder.

"What's wrong, Alfa?"
"PzB, aren't you worried at all?"
"Worried about what?"
"...Nothing."
"Don't always leave your sentences half-finished. This may be our squad's final mission, but we will meet again. All that's left to do is figuring out how to write our transfer request forms. What else is there to worry about?"
"Civilian Dolls in the Green Zone need to have their fire-control cores removed."
"Yeah, that's the process."
"..."
"What's wrong? Just tell me."
"Nothing. But do you actually want to go to the Green Zone? Do you insist on going?"
"To answer your question, Alfa... Well, I really want to learn how to modify motorbikes. There are so many cities in the Green Zone, there's bound to be an opportunity, right? Still, what I really want is to be with Grizz and you lot. You know, we're different from humans. Humans have their parents and relatives because of blood ties, but we can only make friends if we take the initiative. You and Grizz are the most important people to me, so I don't mind going anywhere as long as I can stay with you guys."
"I see."
"But it'd be the best if I can stay with you AND learn how to modify motorbikes!"
"So you still want to go to the Green Zone."
"I get the best of both worlds, so why not?"
...

I didn't need to ask anyone else; I could already tell what their answers would be.
It's true, if one could have the best of both worlds, why would they choose otherwise?
Nobody seemed to be aware of the dangers that came with this choice. For them, encountering danger in the Green Zone was a statistical improbability. Giving up a bright future for such an unlikely scenario just wasn't worth it.
But if this unlikely scenario happened even once, they'd be gone. For good.
Their new owners would not be as generous as Griffin. There's no guarantee that they would give their Dolls neural backups or provide new frames for them like the red-haired woman did. It all depends heavily on the owners' attitude and financial situation. It's like trying to predict the aurora; before night falls, no one can know for sure if the aurora will actually appear.
This means that I might lose them.
The majestic transit of Mercury only happens once in many years, but if you wait patiently, it will eventually appear. Losing them, however, was forever. Once it happens, there's no going back.
Even though my frame's temperature regulation was normal, I felt cold. I listened with a blank face as they talked about the wonderful lives they would lead after reassignment, unable to make a sound as if my vocal module was broken.

I don't want to ruin everyone's pursuit of a better future, but I also don't want any harm to come to them.
There has to be a way that would actually let us have the best of both worlds.

A few hours later, the helicopter flew us back to Griffin.
Grizzly gave a quick rundown of the situation, and our last mission as Squad Grizzly was over. After the Commander left, even if we stayed at Griffin, things had changed...
Grizzly suggested we all get together one last time before disbanding to mark the end of our time at Griffin and get ready for a new beginning.
There was no reason to say no, so I agreed.

The meetup spot was in a small grove a short distance away from Griffin headquarters.
On the agreed day, I brought the projector and speakers as Grizzly had asked and arrived right on time. PzB39 was carrying a bunch of action movie DVDs, carefully guarding them like a penguin guarding an egg. M590 was helping with PzB39's motorbike, which had new graffiti on it—a cute plush brown bear. It was obvious who had done it. Grizz brought a few bottles of beer, and I knew they were for me. M82 had prepared a whole box of fireworks. The box was so tall it completely hid her face, but I could still tell she was in a good mood from her cheerful steps.
All of Griffin was wrapped in the sadness of farewells, but my teammates didn't seem to feel that way. Maybe it was because we had all planned to go to the Green Zone together. What they didn't know was that I hadn't submitted my application yet. I was still hesitating.

I put the projector down and set it up absentmindedly. The beam of the projector hit a dense patch of leaves, like a natural screen. PzB39 put the disc in place. After a small hiss, a certain over the top theme song blasted from the speakers.
M82 opened a bottle of beer for me. This time, my olfactory module picked up the fresh smell of malt and hops. I closed my eyes and drank the whole bottle of beer.
Watching everyone bustling around, I tried to voice my concerns.
"So... why are we all going to the Green Zone? There's nothing wrong with staying in Griffin, right?"
"There's nothing wrong with that, but there are too few spots to stay in Griffin, and we can do more in the Green Zone!"
"Yeah, my motorbike needs more modifications. High-horsepower acceleration is essential for it. If I stay in Griffin, how will I have time to modify it?"
"Griffin's database doesn't have as many sci-fi novels as the city library..."
My teammates answered my questions rather flippantly.

"But the Green Zone isn't always safe. Just like last time, we almost got hurt during the mission. That Doll named Claire also—"
"Events like that are so rare, they barely happen once a year!"
"Yeah, Alfa, what's up with you today? You're overthinking things. This isn't like you."
"Exactly! Normally, you'd already be dragging PzB to find a good spot to watch the stars. You did say you wanted to see that thing this year, something Mercury...? What was it again...?"
"The transit of Mercury."
I couldn't help but add.
"Yes! That. You're really acting strange today, Alfa. Are you hiding something from us?"
Looking at my teammates' faces of genuine concern, I opened my mouth, but I found myself unable to voice my misgivings.
I need more time to figure this out.
What I know for sure is that my teammates are all excited about their future in the Green Zone, but...
Claire's empty eyes still linger in my mind.
How can I convince them to stay, and is it really right to ask them to? Staying at Griffin means continuing to fight, and those beautiful dreams about the future will vanish.
This isn't the outcome I desire.

"Alfa, what's up with you? You keep making different faces. It's as if you've used up a year's worth of expressions tonight."
"Oh, I'm fine. I got really excited when you mentioned the transit of Mercury. Yeah, that's it."
"Just because of that? Well, it's hard to understand, but I'm really into modifying motorbikes myself, so I can't really judge you... Once we get to the Green Zone, we'll have plenty of time to mess around with our own hobbies."
...
My teammates' kind attempts to smooth things over made me feel even guiltier, and before I knew it, I'd downed another bottle of beer.
If I stay behind and use Griffin's power to help everyone when needed, and let Grizzly and the others go to the Green Zone, would that be the best solution?
My hand holding the beer bottle twitched when this idea emerged. It's definitely doable. As long as the reorganized Griffin can ensure the supply of provisions, provide the necessary frame maintenance, and also give me some free time, this plan can solve all problems in one go.
But another issue immediately came to mind—
If I stay at Griffin alone, it means I'll be breaking my previous promise. I had promised to go to the Green Zone with the rest of the team...

Right now, I really wish that person were still at Griffin, so I could knock on their door for answers.
But that's not possible... and if the Commander were still in Griffin, the choice we would have made was obvious.

Just as I was feeling conflicted, M82 lit the fireworks. A golden lion with bared fangs and claws roared fiercely in the sky, a motorbike leapt across a gap and soared through the air, and the bright arm of a galaxy sprang out of a thick open book. Fireworks ignited one by one, and finally Squad Grizzly's logo was fixed in the night sky before it slowly faded and went out softly in the night breeze.
The team logo was pretty simple. We drew it together when the team was formed. Everyone added a stroke, and the final product looked kind of odd. The so-called majestic brown bear actually looked more like a chubby big cat.
At first, my teammates cheered, then they gradually fell silent. In the end, we all held hands and watched the custom fireworks show together.
"A fine commemoration, is it not?"
M82 asked softly.
I quickly nodded.

Perhaps it was because we missed the days at Griffin, or perhaps it was the mesmerizing patterns. After the fireworks ended, no one left right away. We kept changing out the discs on the projector, chatting about the past and the future.
I sat on a hill not too far from them—they were already used to me keeping my distance.
The soft cloth beneath me was dry and clean. I lay down gently and gazed up at the night sky. The stars were vast and countless as they shone brightly. The cool night breeze gradually blew away the noise from my teammates.
Even though it was the perfect place to think in peace and quiet, I found myself unable to calm down.

Stay at Griffin or accept reassignment?
Staying at Griffin means I can keep protecting everyone.
Accepting reassignment means I can keep my original promise. Like Grizzly said in the beginning, as long as we're all together, Squad Grizzly hasn't really disbanded.

My neural cloud has already arrived at the most reasonable conclusion, but I just can't seem to take that step, and I can't honestly share my worries with Grizzly and the others. If they knew I chose to stay, they'd definitely stick with me, but I can't be the one to crush those dreams.
...
Looking at the vast starry sky, I gently asked the stars, "Can you tell me what I should do...?"
With the Commander not here, I have only them to ask.
My question went unanswered. Only the night wind blew gently, lifting my long hair.
"I guess I have a lot of time tonight to think about this..."
I turned over and hugged my knees to my chest.

Finally, as the sky gradually brightened, I found my own answer.

I submitted the application.
It would take some time for the final arrangements of Griffin Dolls to be announced.
Just before leaving, I spent time with Grizzly and the others as usual, but unlike them, I wasn't filled with hope for the future, nor did I pack my luggage, putting my most important belongings into the suitcase one by one. I've been waiting, like a red giant star gradually dying. I don't know if I'll become a bright nebula or a black hole in the future.
With 24 hours left before the arrangements were announced, I hid in my dorm room. I wanted to stay in my own little world until everyone left.

I was too naive.
The next morning, Grizzly and the others came into my little space.
"Open up, Alfa! We need to talk to you!"
"Alfa, didn't we agree to get reassigned together?"
"Yeah, Alfa, are you having some kind of problem? We can solve it together!"
They kept knocking on the door, their voices urgent and frantic. I looked at my teammates through the narrow gap of the dorm door, just like the red-haired Doll we encountered in Griffin's last mission for us—their faces were confused, puzzled, and mostly anxious.
They probably never expected me to make such a decision.
The knocking went on for five minutes. I stayed completely silent, pretending I wasn't in the room.
"Grizzly, maybe Alfa isn't here."
"Hmm... let's check somewhere else. It's so reckless of Alfa to not discuss something this big with us."
"Maybe Alfa has her reasons?"
My teammates talked for a bit outside the door. After making sure I wasn't in the dorm, they finally left. I slid down onto the rug against the door with a huge sense of relief and stared blankly at the logo of "Outer Polaris" on the rug.
"I'm sorry, I lied to you guys..."

Before long, the inbox on my terminal started blowing up with messages from teammates, mostly worried and asking questions. I looked at them for a good while, then I finally blocked all my teammates to prevent myself from losing my resolve.
This way, everyone could move on and start afresh in the Green Zone.
Just in case my teammates decided to double back to look for me in the dorm again, I fully charged myself and hiked up a nearby hill alone. I wanted to spend some time on my own here.
I stayed quietly during the day, and at night, I watched the stars in the night sky.
But much to my surprise, they actually came looking for me here!
While I was hugging my knees and stargazing, the clouds moved away, and the moonlight shone upon my teammates in the distance. Under the moonlight, they looked like tiny dots, walking towards where I was.
To avoid being discovered, I quickly found a large rock nearby and hid behind it.
My teammates' footsteps were getting closer, and I could hear their voices.
"Would she really be here, PzB?"
"She's not in the dorm. Based on her habits, this is the only place left. Anyway, let's look around."
"Why does she keep hiding from us? Are we that scary?"
"I always feel like Alfa has something on her mind that she can't tell us."
"Why can't she? What's so hard to say to us?"
"I don't know..."
Their voices were almost within arm's reach as they approached the rock where I was hiding. I tried my best not to make a sound.
"She's not here."
"She's not here either."
"Same here."
...
I heard a heavy sigh.

"In that case, we'll just have to look elsewhere," Grizzly said. Just from her tone, I could sense her disappointment.
"Alfa, what are you really thinking?"
As my teammates slowly dispersed, I caught that final question.
I-I just wanted a win-win solution; I just wanted to protect everyone... 
But I couldn't say this out loud. 

There was six hours left, and to prevent them from returning, I left the hill. 
But where could I go...? Perhaps I shouldn't go to places that I visit frequently. Based on this thought, I chose an abandoned warehouse in Griffin as my last hideout. 
I silently watched the dust in the air rise and fall, calculating the moment they left. I thought; they won't be able to find me here. 
I cut my neural cloud connection, mitigated my heat signature, and waited for that moment to arrive. 
But they still found me. The first one to show up was M82.

I was staring at a dark spot on the ceiling that was corroded by rust and mold. It looked a lot like the Orion Nebula.
A familiar voice suddenly broke the silence.
"Alfa, there you are! I finally found you! Why are you hiding here?"
I jumped up from the ground, but my frame, which had suddenly ramped up its processing speed, couldn't adjust in time. I felt dizzy and stumbled back.
"I-I just needed to think through some things..."
"Think through some things?"
M82 gave me an incredulous look, clearly not buying my lie.
"Alfa, you know, you're really bad at lying. I've already told Grizz and the others, they'll be here soon."
"What?! I-I'm outta here." Hearing they were coming, I immediately motioned to leave, but M82 quickly blocked my way.
"You're not getting away this time. We need to clear some things up." She spread her arms like a hawk, blocking the door and firmly cutting off my escape until the storage door gave rise to the sound of knocks.
M82 watched me closely and opened the door. Outside were Grizzly, PzB39, and M590.
I had finally been caught.

"Alfa, tell us, why do you want to stay at Griffin?" Grizzly had asked this question many times. I had heard it many times too, and now it's finally time for me to answer.
"If you have any concerns, you have to let us know."
"Squad Grizzly is a unit. As long as we're together, we haven’t disbanded."
"Alfa, all the promises we made before still stand. Whether you want to go to the best stargazing spot in the Green Zone or drink the best beer in the Green Zone, we’re still down for it."
...
My teammates kept asking, waiting for my explanation and my decision.
As I looked at them, the image of Claire's lifeless and disfigured face appeared before my eyes again, overlapping with their faces... No, I don't want this! I clenched my fists and gritted my teeth: "What you're offering, Griffin can also give me, and under better conditions to boot!"

Surprise, sadness, disbelief... I saw all kinds of expressions on their faces.
Yes, abandon me. Let go of this asteroid and let it gradually drift to the other end of the orbit... I'll navigate the vast universe on my own, and when the time is right, I'll fly back to see you again...

"Alfa, you're not serious, are you?"
"Of course I'm serious, PzB. I've told you before, as long as I can see the stars, it doesn't matter where I go. Even if Griffin's resources are scarce, it's still much more abundant than places like an auto repair shop or a library."
"Is this... the reason you want to stay?"
Grizzly asked again.
"Yes, staying at Griffin allows me to observe the stars more easily. That's the reason I want to stay."
My response left them speechless, and PzB's eyes turned red with tears. I felt my eyes water too, but before I could say "I changed my mind," I shoved them roughly out the door.
"Alfa!"
"Go away and leave me alone."
I slammed the door shut in their faces.

I waited a while, but didn't hear their footsteps leaving outside the door.
They... must be really disappointed in me.
I sat in the abandoned warehouse and watched the morning sunlight gradually seep through the broken cracks without saying a word for a long time.
Within a week after the announcement, they would have to go to the Green Zone.

I made this decision myself.
I have no regrets.

A week quickly flew by.
I completely cut all contact with Grizzly and the others, and they responded with silence in kind. I no longer avoided them. When we occasionally passed by one other, we pretended not to know each other. In the situations where we had to interact, we treated one another with politeness and courtesy, an unspoken understanding between us.

Finally, the bus carrying the Dolls to the Green Zone stopped steadily in front of Griffin's main entrance. The Dolls were lined up with colorful suitcases of various sizes. The bright red bus was very noticeable in the sunlight.
Indeed, it was very noticeable... I think I'll remember this scene till the day I stop functioning.
Here I was, hiding in a spot where I could see the bus from a distance, away from the crowd. I tried to spot Grizzly and the others. As long as they didn't see me, it was fine, I thought.
But Grizzly and the others were not there.

I waited there for a long time until the bus was about to leave. Just then, they showed up, all flustered. There was mud on their shoes, and I knew where they had been—they wanted to talk to me one last time before leaving. Only in that abandoned warehouse was there such wet mud.
But luckily, they didn't miss the bus.

The young attendant looked impatient, urging Grizzly and the others to get on the bus like a worker packing sardines. Grizzly kept looking back, and I instinctively shrunk further back behind the pillar that could hide my figure.
They didn't see me.
After failing to find me, they boarded the bus with their suitcases in disappointment.
The attendant closed the door after confirming that all the Dolls were on board. The driver honked twice, and the bus drove off smoothly. At that moment, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.
Finally, the situation that entangled me so, that led me into hiding during this time has come to an end. I don't have to sneak around like before. Grizzly and the others can go to the Green Zone and do what they want. Plus, by staying at Griffin, I can keep an eye on them and protect them whenever I needed to.
I achieved what I intended to achieve, so why do I still feel so sad?
I turned around stiffly. It must be because of my low battery that I'm feeling so down right now.
Just as I was about to head back to the dorm, the clouds in the sky cleared up, and the daylight became even brighter, almost scorching on my skin. Why would this be bothering me? Could it be—
The terminal I carried with me suddenly started vibrating, like a comet streaking across the starry sky in my mind. I froze in place. How could this be happening?! At this moment—when I watched all my companions leave with my own eyes, the transit of Mercury had begun...
It was like the darkest joke straight out of a sci-fi novel...
But there was no way I was going to miss this!
I've always wanted to see this celestial event, and missing it was not an option!

I dragged my heavy feet, dashed to the dorm, burst through the door, dove into my room, and rushed to my telescope by the window.
I quickly adjusted the angle and aimed it at the sun—

This gigantic, orange-red star... Most of the planets in the solar system seemed all too insignificant compared to it. The very center of the solar system, and one of the foundations of human existence. If it changed, ever so slightly, the entirety of the solar system would be affected.
Just then, I spotted a round black dot moving across this massive star. It was moving so slowly that you could hardly notice any displacement within that period of time.
Compared to the sun, it was so tiny and so lonely. If you didn't look closely, you wouldn't even realize it was covering a corner of the sun...
Yes, this round black dot was Mercury.
Everything I saw at that moment was the transit of Mercury, something I had always longed to see.

I stared at the sky, my hands trembling uncontrollably, feeling an overwhelming urge to cry.
This wasn't happiness, it was...
Sadness...
Why do I feel so sad?
...Alfa, you chose to stay in Griffin because you thought you could protect everyone and observe the universe. Now, the celestial event you've been waiting for is here, so why aren't you happy?

Why aren't I happy?
I forced myself to take pictures of this amazing sight.
"At very least... I should have a memento."
Like chanting a spell, I quickly adjusted the camera I had prepared, but no matter how I set the parameters, the photos turned out terrible—they were either underexposed or out of focus. I was too panicked, my mind went blank, and my hands were shaking uncontrollably, causing these constant errors.

Even so, I forced myself to take photo after photo until the camera's memory card was completely full. I collapsed to the ground, exhausted.
"How could this happen...? I need more memory space, that's it..."
Struggling to get up, I tried to switch to a larger memory card, but I just couldn't do it. My hands were shaking too much to handle the delicate machine...

...Did I actually make a mistake?
Was it wrong for me to want to protect everyone?
But... does that justify how I deceived them, hurt them with harsh words, and broke my promises?
There's a photo on the wall of a meteor shower, streaking past the sky above my teammates' fluffy hair. I took that photo of them a long time ago.
If I stay here, their safety is assured. If we can't even ensure our existence, how could we talk about living together or living a good life? This thought suddenly came to me.

Looking at the photo, I gritted my teeth.
I did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong.
I did say some hurtful things, but it was all for their safety.
If it was the Commander, they would understand me.
They can go to the Green Zone and live the life they want, and with my support, they can stay safe. So, everything I did was right.
I won't let them become Dolls with bullet holes in their foreheads, like the one at that inn.

Misunderstandings and sadness are just side effects of making the right choice. As long as I can protect my teammates, I can endure everything I'm going through now.
I...
I have no regrets.
