ENT.Information		= "The Varjagers are an organization of bandits active in the contamination zones of Eastern Europe since 2066.\nWearing similar uniforms (gas masks, helmets and heavy protective suits) and well-armed, including assault mechs starting 2070,\nthey specialize in cruel looting raids, but the URNC hasn't taken action against them since they rarely target purified regions.\nThey mostly attack Yellow Zone settlements and convoys, and sometimes the Intercontinental Railway.\nThe Varjagers were originally a multitude of bandit groups who became organized under a single leader, though their structure remains loose.\nThe overall leader of the Varjagers is unknown, known leaders include Berserl (deceased), Ravn (deceased) and Glasir.\nThey are prime targets for bounty hunters and are known to both cooperate with and attack Underground Brokers.\nIt seems the only settlements they won't attack are the contamination sects.\n"
